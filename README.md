## Experience
Previous (and currently), I have...

**Elements of Mathematics 10**
Worked on creating multiple interactive online mathematics textbooks in collaboration with my high school. Utilized BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML downloaded using Google Docs's API. Created a Flask application including user authentication, and the ability for students to create written and whiteboard notes, which were then auto-saved to their account. Used Flask, along with programming concepts such as debouncing (delayed function calls) and secure deployment on an Ubuntu server with a PostgreSQL database.

**[CodeIO](https://codeio.tech)** @ codeio.tech
Created a platform that interactively assesses coding skills through auto-graded problems. Has support for over 40 programming languages. Used AWS S3 and EC2 instances for the file storage and deployment, respectively. Utilized Flask for the backend and the CSS framework Bulma for the frontend. Currently being used in production in an ed-tech business that teaches coding.
